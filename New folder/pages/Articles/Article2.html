    <p><i><h2>PLANTS:</h2></i>Plants are beneficial to us in a variety of ways. Plants offer seeds such as wheat, rice, corn, and other foods that we consume on a daily basis. Plants provide us with oxygen and take in the carbon dioxide that we release. This helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and reduces global warming. Plants are a part of beautiful nature. They are very important for our survival. They purify the air and make our environment healthy to live in. There are different types of plants, some are small and some are big. We see them everywhere, in our gardens, parks and even in our homes. They play an important role in making our surroundings attractive.Apart from their beauty, plants are important for us in many ways. They produce oxygen which is necessary for our breathing. They also help in controlling pollution as they absorb harmful gases from the atmosphere.

        <p><i><h2>LEAVES:</h2></i>The leaf reminds me of a shamrock due to the three leaves protruding out of its petiole. The two leaves attached at the side of the petiole are similar in size. Furthermore, the center most leaf has an upward curve. The top of the leaf has a smooth wet surface. In contrast, the bottom of the leaf had a chalky texture. The leaf colors also vary. The top of the leaf has a darker green color, while the bottom leaf is a lighter green color. The texture and color differences may be due to photosynthesis. The leaf must be adapted to absorb light so the top of the leaf problably has more chlorophyll. I noticed that each leaf has a midrib going through the center. The midrib starts thick near the petiole, but then decreases in thickness as it travels near the apex. The leaf I was given was noticeably veiny. Each leaf had around eight veins coming out from the midrib. The veins themselves had additional veins coming out of them. This reminded me of a blood under a microscope. The leaf had a musky, skunk like smell. It kind of reminded me of back home where we had lots of skunks running around. The unpleasant smell of the leaf might play a role in repelling insects and birds. What was very interesting for me were the quantitative measurements. The total width of the leaf was 7.2cm wide. The total length of the leaf was 7.2cm. I also noticed that the leaf always felt cold. It seems that the leaf does not hold to heat well.

        <p><i><h2>VEGETABLES:</h2></i>Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E.
